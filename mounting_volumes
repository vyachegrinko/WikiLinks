#attach a volume
go to the volume in the AWS console and under actions, select 'attach.' choose the ec2 instance to attach to


#mount a volume
once the volume is attached, it must be mounted. ssh into your instance:
ssh -i "filename.pem" root@<master's public DNS>

list attached volumes:
lsblk

determine if your volume has a file structure (if it does not, then we will need to make one ourselves):
sudo file -s device

If the output of the previous command shows simply data for the device, then there is no file system on the device and you need to create one like so:

sudo mkfs -t ext4 device_name

make a directory to mount the volume to:
sudo mkdir mount_point

mount the device:
sudo mount device_name mount_point

and finally...update file permissions:
sudo chmod 777
